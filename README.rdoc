== README

My take on Thinkful's testing unit:

Basic wiki-ish application: users can create accounts, log in and then post articles to a category.

Some tests are still pending, but their functionality is covered by other tests. For example, the sessions controller has pending tests, but all of its functionality is covered by the features specs.
